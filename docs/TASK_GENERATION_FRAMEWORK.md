gh project item-add [PROJECT_NUMBER] --owner [ORG] --url [ISSUE_URL]
```

### 3. Label Strategy
- **`front`**: Frontend/UI components and pages
- **`back`**: Backend logic, APIs, database operations
- **`core`**: Fundamental system components (auth, database)
- **`feature`**: New functionality implementation
- **`enhancement`**: Existing feature improvements
- **`bug`**: Bug fixes and issue resolution

## Example: Complete Task Template

```markdown
## Task Details

### Description
Implement user authentication system with registration, login, logout, and protected routes. This foundational task enables all other features by providing secure user management and session handling across the application.

### User Scenarios
1. **New User Registration**: User visits app, clicks "Sign Up", enters email/password, receives confirmation email, and accesses their dashboard
2. **Existing User Login**: User enters valid credentials, gets authenticated, and is redirected to their personalized dashboard
3. **Secure Session Management**: User closes browser and returns later, staying logged in if session hasn't expired
4. **Protected Access Control**: Unauthenticated users cannot access application data or perform any actions

### Technical Implementation Details
- Authentication provider client initialization with proper configuration
- Sign up flow with email verification and error handling
- Sign in with credential validation and session management
- Sign out with complete session cleanup
- Middleware implementation for route protection
- Auth state management and context providers

### Acceptance Criteria
- ‚úÖ User can successfully register with email/password
- ‚úÖ Email verification is sent and required before access
- ‚úÖ User can sign in with valid credentials
- ‚úÖ User can sign out with proper session cleanup
- ‚úÖ Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
- ‚úÖ Auth state persists across browser sessions
- ‚úÖ Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- ‚úÖ Error messages are user-friendly and actionable

### Dependencies
- None (foundational task)

### Priority
High (blocks all other features)

### Estimated Effort
3 story points

### Files to Create/Modify
```
app/(auth)/login/page.tsx
app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx
lib/auth/provider.ts
middleware.ts
components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx
```

### Environment Variables Required
```
AUTH_PROVIDER_URL=authentication_service_url
AUTH_CLIENT_KEY=client_access_key
```
```

## Best Practices & Lessons Learned

### ‚úÖ Do's
- **Always include user scenarios** - Makes tasks relatable and validates real value
- **Be specific with acceptance criteria** - Enables clear verification of completion
- **Include file paths** - Reduces developer guesswork and ensures consistency
- **Consider dependencies** - Prevents blocking work and enables parallel development
- **Add environment variables** - Ensures smooth setup and deployment
- **Include security considerations** - Especially for auth and data operations

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- **Don't create vague tasks** - "Implement authentication" vs "Auth provider with sign up/sign in/sign out"
- **Don't skip dependencies** - Always think about what must be done first
- **Don't forget error handling** - Include in acceptance criteria
- **Don't use technical jargon in user scenarios** - Keep it user-focused
- **Don't create tasks without file paths** - Developers need concrete implementation guidance

### üìä Success Metrics
- **Task Completion Rate**: All tasks should be completable within estimated effort
- **Developer Clarity**: No major questions about task scope or requirements
- **Integration Smoothness**: Tasks fit together without major rework
- **User Value Delivery**: Each task delivers tangible user value

## Tooling & Workflow

### Required Tools
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) for issue creation and project management
- **Project Board** for task visibility and tracking
- **Version/Release Milestones** for progress tracking
- **Consistent Labeling** (front/back/core/feature/enhancement/bug)

### Workflow Steps
1. **Audit Requirements** - Ensure all project areas are covered
2. **Create Tasks** - Use comprehensive template format
3. **Add to Project Board** - For visibility and tracking
4. **Verify Dependencies** - Ensure logical task sequencing
5. **Review Quality** - Check against quality standards
6. **Ready for Development** - Tasks should be immediately actionable

## Effort Estimation Guidelines

### Story Point Scale
- **1 point**: Simple task (few hours) - Basic CRUD operations, small UI changes
- **2 points**: Standard task (half day) - New feature with moderate complexity
- **3 points**: Complex task (full day) - Major feature, API integration, complex UI
- **5 points**: Major task (multiple days) - System overhaul, complex integrations

### Factors to Consider
- **Complexity**: Technical difficulty and unknowns
- **Dependencies**: Waiting time for other tasks
- **Testing**: Amount of testing required
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates needed
- **Review**: Code review and iteration time

### Effort Distribution Guidelines
- **Foundation Tasks**: 15-25% of total effort
- **Core Features**: 40-50% of total effort
- **UI/UX**: 15-25% of total effort
- **Integration & Testing**: 10-20% of total effort
- **Optimization & Polish**: 5-10% of total effort
