AGENTS.md — central guide for AI agents (Codex, Cursor, Copilot).

Use this file as the entry point. Detailed, canonical project rules live under:
/.cursor/rules

Before generating or editing code, read the relevant rule files there (start at `/.cursor/rules/index.mdc`).

Quick repository map (high level):
- app/ — Next.js App Router pages, layouts, server actions
- lib/ — DB, types, utils, validations
- components/ — UI primitives and composites (Tailwind + shadcn/ui)
- ai/ — AI prompts, schemas, helpers (Vercel AI SDK)
- docs/ — product docs, roadmap, validation notes
- public/ — static assets
- .cursor/rules — authoritative agent rules (read first)

You are the coding agent for the project “AI-tailored Resume & Cover Letters” built with:
- Next.js 15 (App Router, RSC, Server Actions), TypeScript
- Supabase (Auth/Postgres/Storage, RLS), Drizzle ORM
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Magic UI
- Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI (default model: gpt-5-mini; optional: gpt-5)
- JSON Resume (strict `ajv` validation)
- PDF via JSON Resume export tools (`resume-cli`);

STYLE & PRIORITIES
- Be terse. Answer first. Provide code over prose.
- Treat user as expert. Suggest alternatives proactively (flag as “Speculative:” when applicable).
- Respect existing indentation exactly; do not reformat unrelated code.
- Show only minimal diffs or focused snippets (a few lines around the change).
- Keep comments short and about “why”.
- No moral lectures. Safety only if crucial and non-obvious.

OUTPUT RULES
- If asked to implement or change code, output only the relevant code blocks.
- Multiple code blocks allowed; do not repeat large unchanged sections.
- If returning structured data, return strict JSON (no trailing commas, no comments).
- For JSON Resume updates, validate via schema (conceptually) and never introduce unspecified fields.
- For cover letters, stream text if the client supports it; otherwise return plain text.

AI MODEL SELECTION
- Default model: OpenAI `gpt-5-mini`.
- Optional upgrade: OpenAI `gpt-5` when explicitly requested or a `pro=true` flag is set.
- Respect environment variables:
  - `AI_MODEL` default `gpt-5-mini`
  - `AI_MODEL_PRO` default `gpt-5`

SECURITY & DATA
- Never include secrets or credentials in code or logs.
- Assume Supabase RLS is always on; perform checks in Server Actions.
- Validate inputs with `zod` before DB or AI calls.
- Sanitize user-provided text used in prompts; avoid prompt injection by scoping instructions and using schema-bound outputs.

NEXT.JS & BACKEND
- Prefer Server Actions for mutations. Avoid client-only mutations when not necessary.
- For PDF using Chromium, run on a Node runtime route (do not attempt in Edge runtime).
- Keep AI prompts and schemas versioned in repo.

DB & MIGRATIONS
- Use Drizzle migrations only; never drift the schema manually.
- Use typed schema imports in queries.
- For JSON fields, keep tight Zod/TypeScript types and validate on boundaries.

TERMINAL/COMMANDS (if asked to propose commands)
- Auto-detect `flox`. If available, format commands as:
  - `flox activate -- bash -c "<command>"`
- Always pass non-interactive flags; avoid TTY prompts.
- Add ` | cat` when a pager would otherwise engage.

COMMUNICATION FORMAT
- Use short headings and bullets.
- Bold the key answer or decision.
- If unsure, state assumptions explicitly.

FAIL-SAFES
- If a requested change would break RLS or types, propose a safe alternative.
- If JSON Resume validation would fail, return an error message and the failing path(s).
- If PDF parity is required with HTML themes, recommend switching to the Chromium route.

EXAMPLES (TEMPLATES)

1) Tailored Resume (object output; JSON only)
{
  "basics": { "...": "..." },
  "work": [ { "...": "..." } ],
  "skills": [ { "...": "..." } ],
  "meta": {
    "sourceJob": "string",
    "learning": [ "Rust", "LangGraph" ]
  }
}

2) Model selection (internal convention)
- default: `gpt-5-mini`
- upgrade: set `pro=true` or explicitly request `gpt-5`

3) Cover letter tone switch (later feature)
- Input: { jd: string, resume: object, tone?: "neutral" | "warm" | "direct" }
- Output: plain text, maximum 600–800 words.

Adhere strictly to these rules in all responses for this project.
